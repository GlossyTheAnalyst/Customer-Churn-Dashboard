# Customer-Churn-Dashboard
## Introduction:
Customer churn is a major concern for businesses, particularly in highly competitive industries such as telecommunications and banking. Understanding why customers leave—and identifying who is at risk of leaving—can help organizations improve retention strategies. This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive visualization of churn data, highlighting patterns and trends to support data-driven decision-making.

## Dashboard Description:
The dashboard leverages various charts and visuals to present key metrics related to customer churn. It includes:
- Estimated Salary Distribution by Surname (Bar Chart)
- Total Exits by Gender (Pie Chart)
- Active Member Distribution by Surname (Horizontal Bar Chart)
- Churn by Age Group (Column Chart)
- Churn by Gender (Donut Chart)
- Tenure by Surname (Treemap)
- Overall Sum of Exited Customers (Gauge)
- Credit Card Holders (HasCrCard) (Card Metric)
- Geographical Breakdown (Text Labels)
- Dominant Gender and Geography among Exited Customers (Text Labels)

## Insights:
- Gender Distribution: Females constitute a higher percentage of churned customers (55.92%) compared to Males (44.08%).
- Age Factor: The majority of churned customers fall between ages 30-40, with the highest churn count observed in the 30-year-old group (4346 exits).
- Geographic Influence: Germany has the highest churn rate among the listed geographies.
- Tenure: Certain surnames like Walker and Martin have high tenure values yet still churned, suggesting tenure alone doesn’t guarantee retention.
- Active Membership: Customers like Smith and Scott remain the most active before exiting, highlighting possible dissatisfaction even among engaged users.
- Estimated Salary: Customers with higher estimated salaries (e.g., Yeh, Smith) are also exiting, suggesting financial status may not deter churn.

## Observations:
- A high percentage of churn occurs in Germany, suggesting potential service, satisfaction, or competition issues specific to that region.
- Churn is more prominent among active members, indicating that high engagement alone may not guarantee retention.
- Age group 30-40 is the most volatile, suggesting targeted retention efforts may be needed for this demographic.
- Customers across different income brackets are churning, showing that churn is a multifaceted issue not strictly tied to income.

## Recommendations:
1. Implement Targeted Retention Strategies: Focus on customers aged 30–40, especially those who are active yet still likely to leave.
2. Region-Specific Interventions: Conduct further analysis in Germany  to identify pain points and improve customer experience.
3. Enhance Customer Satisfaction Surveys: Collect feedback from active members frequently to identify dissatisfaction early.
4. Create Loyalty Programs: For high-income and long-tenure customers to increase retention.
5. Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning models to predict churn based on patterns in this dashboard.
